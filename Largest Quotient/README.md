# LARGEST QUOTIENT

Using an array of integers, your application will need to calculate the largest number possible by dividing any two integers in the array. For example, if the array contained 5, 4, 19, 20, 33, the largest number possible is 8 calculated as 33 / 4. Display the integer result. Truncate any decimal digits.

### Input:

Prompt for the input as shown below. Enter a series of integers each separated by a space. The final digit will be a zero indicating the end of the input. The series of integers will contain only positive (non-zero) integers. The series will contain at least two integers and fewer than 15. Data will be entered from console. You do not need to edit the input data. Rerun your application to test each test case.

### Output:

A single integer number representing the largest quotient possible using the input.
